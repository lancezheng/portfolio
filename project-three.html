       <h2>Description of the project</h2>
       <p>The goal of the project is to analyze interactions within MLGB e-sports club and design a technology solution to improved the biggest problem so that they can improve both in profit and working process.

       </p>
       <h2>Project Process </h2>
       <p> Conduct Research, Analyzed results and Generated poster to show results - Created app concept and wireframe - Design the interface of the app

      I would illustrate my part in the following section.
       </p>
       <h2>Conduct Research, Analyzed results and Generated poster to show results</h2>
       <p>
         We conduct different research  through the following process:
       </p>
       <p>
         Interviewed groups of staffs - Created Personas - Create Culture Probes -  Deployed culture probes - Conduct Participatory Workshop
       </p>
       <p>
         In the first week, we investigated the environment and interviewed the staffs in MlGB E-sports Club in order to create an in-depth and concise understanding of the group's operation and mission.
       </p>
       <div class="listings--project">
         <a href="img/mlgb-group-poster.jpg" target="_blank" >
           <img src="img/mlgb-group-poster.jpg" alt="Participant Group Slide" class="img-responsive project-image">
         </a>
      </div>
       <p>
        We decide that our design focus is to find a easier way for the staffs to communicate both between each others and with customers. Based on the design focus, we created user journey map and persona for that.

       </p>
       <div class="listings--project">
         <a href="img/mlgb-persona.jpg" target="_blank" >
           <img src="img/mlgb-persona.jpg" alt="persona" class="img-responsive project-image">
         </a>
         <a href="img/mlgb-user-journey-map.jpg" target="_blank" >
           <img src="img/mlgb-user-journey-map.jpg" alt="user journey map" class="img-responsive project-image">
         </a>

      </div>
       <p>
        Through deeply investigation of culture probes and participatory workshop, we revised our design focus to create better customer service through an self-service app.
       </p>


       <h2>Created app concept</h2>
       <p>
        I created app concepts for our group.  We realized that the biggest problems in MLGB E-sports Club is that customers are busy playing games. They want to minimize the activities that influenced them through gaming. Though the app , they can know the left seats in MLGB E-sports Club and they can reserve seats to save time. What’s more, they can top up their fee and order food so that they don’t need to stop the game.  They can interact with other gamers in MLGB E-sports Club when they want to form the team inside the club. 

       </p>
       <h2> Design the interface of the app </h2>
       <p>
         Through wireframe that created by my teammates, I created the interface of the app.
       </p>
       <div class="listings--project">
         <a href="img/mlgb-interface-design.png" target="_blank" >
           <img src="img/mlgb-interface-design.png" alt="MLGB Interface Design" class="img-responsive project-image">
         </a>
      </div>
       <h2> Retrospective </h2>
       <p>
         We found that it’s hard to get customer insights through normal research. I tried to redesign the specify research problems so that  we can get better sense of the problems in the E-sports Club.

         The staffs’ schedules are flexible so that it’s hard to know the connect between both staffs to customers and customers to customers. So we tried different interviewing methods such as  Ethnographic research and Interview through phone. Customers are busy playing games so that we tried to design our culture probes and workshops in a fun and easiest way.
