       <h2>Description of the project</h2>
       <p>In this project, One of our customers wanted to open a fitness studio from scratch. The goal of this project is to design a new brand concept, website and marketing materials such as brochures and posters. 

       </p>
       <h2>Project Process </h2>
       <p>Defined the brand - created user-flow wireframes - created style guide - enriched content and built the website - browser testing / responsive testing - Generated brochure and poster

       </p>
       <h2>Defined the brand </h2>
       <p>
       Mighty Life Fitness (MLF) is a strength and conditioning gym for young and middle-aged adults looking to become stronger and more fit. It offers straightforward and affordable gym membership as well as training packages with highly-experienced coaches from various backgrounds.

       Fitness is a lifestyle, not an activity. Mighty Life Fitness projects this mantra by having a brand concept that connects the idea of strength and power with the classical element of earth, which symbolizes fortitude and growth. MLF also aims to be approachable and inspiring to potential members, thus it harnesses lightweight and earth-like aesthetics to convey a positive vibe while deviating away from the typical “raw” black and white theme of strength gym brands.

       </p>
       <h2> Created user-flow wireframes </h2>
       <p>
         Analyzed user-flow to determine how the website structure will be and what key content should be in there.

       </p>

       <h2> Created style guide </h2>
       <p>
         Created a style guide to keep consistent design style in the way.

       </p>

       <h2> Built the website </h2>
       <p>
         Started a sitemap to see what should be included in the website.  Contents were written and collected pictures for marketing materials and website. While picking the pictures, wepicked more less commercial pictures in order to increase the customers’ feeling of trust.

         The website was designed with the strict responsive rule and aimed to be a straight-forward    introduction to Mighty Life Fitness and the fitness services it provides.

         Open Website
       </a>
     </p>

       <h2>Generated brochure and poster</h2>
       <p>
         Through the extension of the concept, I decided on a consistent style (font, color palette, content) between brochures/posters along with the website. 
       </p>
       <h2> Retrospective</h2>
       <p>
         I learned how to quickly shape a brand with design solutions. Worked with Charlie, to keep improving coding and learn how to stay on schedule with an efficient working style.  

        It was hard to find the proper images in the beginning. I searched and learned how to find images and learned a lot through different designer blogs.

        Designing the website was fun and meaningful for me because I started to learn how to keep improving the project and even myself.
