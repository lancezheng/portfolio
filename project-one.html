       <h2 class="project-subtitle">Description of the project</h2>
       <p>In this project, I need to design a fitness brand from scratch. The goal of this project is to design a new brand concept, website and marketing materials such as brochures and posters. 

       </p>
       <h2 class="project-subtitle">Project Process </h2>
       <p>Defined the brand - created user-flow wireframes - created style guide - enriched content and built the website - browser testing / responsive testing - Generated brochure and poster
    
       </p>
       <h2 class="project-subtitle">Defined the brand </h2>
       <p>
       Mighty Life Fitness (MLF) is a strength and conditioning gym for young and middle-aged adults looking to become stronger and more fit. It offers straightforward and affordable gym membership as well as training packages with highly-experienced coaches from various backgrounds.

       Fitness is a lifestyle, not an activity. Mighty Life Fitness projects this mantra by having a brand concept that connects the idea of strength and power with the classical element of earth, which symbolizes fortitude and growth. MLF also aims to be approachable and inspiring to potential members, thus it harnesses lightweight and earth-like aesthetics to convey a positive vibe while deviating away from the typical “raw” black and white theme of strength gym brands.

       </p>


       <h2 class="project-subtitle"> Created style guide </h2>

        I want to create a style guide to keep consistent design style in the way. You can open the styleguide to see the details.

       <h2 class="project-subtitle"> Built the website </h2>
       <p>
         I started a sitemap to see what should be included in the website.  Then I wrote contents and collect pictures for marketing material and website. While picking the pictures, I aimed to pick more non-commercial pictures in order to increase the customers’ feeling of trust. Charlie and me changed pictures in the process for a few times. In order to find the pictures that match our style, I searched the image website and I learn how to find proper image through different designer blogs.
       </p>
       <p>
         The website was designed with the strict responsive rule. The website was aimed to be a straight-forward introduction to Mighty Life Fitness and the fitness services it provides. In coding process, I felt hard to follow Charlie because he is a professional coding programmer. But through his help and learning from tutorial, I feel I got improved in HTML/CSS skills .Now I feel confident that I can work as a front-end developer and build website by myself.

       <h2 class="project-subtitle">Generated brochure and poster</h2>
       <p>
         Through the extension of the concept, I decided the consistent style (font, color palette, content) between brochure/poster with the website.

       <h2 class="project-subtitle"> Retrospective</h2>
       <p>
         I learned how to quickly shape a brand with design solutions. Worked with Charlie, I am keeping improving in coding and learn how to keep the project schedule with an efficient working style.

         It was hard to find the proper images in the beginning. I searched for how to find the image and I learned a lot through different designer blogs.

         Iterating the website is fun and meaningful for me because I started to learn how to keep improving the project and even myself.
